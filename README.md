# Final Project - iChallengeYou
===============================

## Description

iChallengeYou is an app that allows you to check out challenges in a local geography, attempt them, and submit attempts onto the app for verification and community voting. If a submission has too many downvotes, it will be hidden from view to prevent abusive or lewd submissions.
